      This October international break marks two significant anniversaries at Liverpool: 10 years since Fenway Sports Group purchased
      the club and five years since Jurgen Klopp was appointed manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      When FSG (then known as New England Sports Ventures) completed their takeover they vowed to “under promise and over deliver” - something that is increasingly hard to do in an extremely competitive Premier League. At the time, chairman Tom
      Werner was probably unaware of quite the mess they had inherited at Anfield.

      Liverpool hadn’t won a trophy for four years and it was 20 years since the title had been in the Merseysiders’ trophy cabinet. But the issues were far, far greater than silverware. Managed by Roy Hodgson and with a squad bloated with massively
      overpaid players who were not of the quality required, it would need time and
      patience to get Liverpool back to the elite.
    </p>
    <p>
      FSG had a plan but mistakes were made early on. Crucially, though, these mistakes were learned from and after five years the American owners finally got their man when Jurgen Norbert Klopp was appointed at Anfield on October 8, 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some sceptics say FSG got lucky with Klopp, and while they did, they also created their luck. Appointing Klopp showed their ambitions at Anfield and underlined their commitment to restoring the club to the pinnacle of European football.
    </p>
    <p>
      FSG wanted Klopp earlier than when he was eventually appointed, and when they did get the opportunity to appoint the German they allowed him to implement his vision.

      So often in modern football, an elite club will appoint an elite manager but either not give them the time to implement their long-term vision, or the two parties are not aligned about how to get to their eventual end goal. In Klopp and FSG,
      the two had a perfectly aligned vision - and patience that they both understood was required.

      Remember, merely 18 months ago Klopp hadn’t won a trophy at Liverpool. His first season in charge resulted in an eighth-place finish. Defeats arrived in the League Cup final, the Europa League final, and later the Champions League final in
      2018. Some clubs may have grown impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having started the 2021–22 season with five wins and three draws from the first eight league fixtures, on 24 October 2021, Liverpool beat Manchester United 5–0 at Old Trafford.This was Klopp’s 200th victory in 331 games in charge of
      Liverpool, making him the fastest manager in the club’s history to reach that milestone. On 1 December, Klopp led Liverpool to a 4–1 away win against Everton in the Premier League as the club became the first team in English top-flight
      history to score at least two goals in 18 successive games in all competitions. On 7 December, Liverpool won 2–1 away against A.C. Milan at the San Siro and became the first English club to win all six Champions League group games in the
      competition's history. On 16 December, Klopp became the fastest manager in Liverpool history to record 150 league wins with a 3–1 home win against Newcastle United in what was Liverpool's 2000th top-flight win, the first club in English
      history to reach this landmark. On 27 February 2022, he led Liverpool to their first domestic final since 2016, the 2022 EFL Cup Final where they defeated Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea 11-10 on penalties after a 0-0 draw that went to extra
      time.[189] It was a record-breaking 9th victory for Liverpool, and the first time they had won it since 2012. Following Sean Dyche's dismissal by Burnley on 15 April, Klopp became the longest serving manager in the Premier League. On
      28 April, Klopp signed a two-year contract extension, extending his stay at Liverpool until 2026 In his announcement to the Liverpool supporters, he cited his wife Ulla, as one of the main reasons for signing the contract. On 3 May,
      Klopp secured his fourth Champions League final as manager and third as Liverpool manager by defeating Villareal 5-2 on aggregate (2-0 at Anfield) to play Real Madrid in the final at Paris. On 14 May, Liverpool won their first FA Cup since 2006
      where they again defeated Chelsea, this time 6-5 on penalties after a 0-0 draw that went to extra time. Tsimikas scored the winning penalty. The FA Cup victory was the 8th in Liverpool's history, and Klopp became the first German manager to win
      the FA Cup. Klopp's quadruple hopes came to an end on 22 May as, despite defeating Wolves 3-1, Manchester City came back to win 3-2 in such a short space of time after equalising and going ahead after being 0-2 down against Aston Villa.
